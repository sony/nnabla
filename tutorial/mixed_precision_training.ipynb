    "Traditionally, for training a neural network, we used to use `FP32` for weights and activations; however computation costs for training a neural network rapidly increase over years as the success of deep learning and the growing size of a neural network. It indicates that we need to spend much more time for training a huge size of a neural network while we would like to do lots of trials before a product launch. To address this problem, companies (e.g., NVIDIA) introduced an accelerator for speeding up computation. For example, NVIDIA Volta has [Tensor Cores](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/programming-tensor-cores-cuda-9/) to speed up computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it uses `FP16` weights, activations, gradients, and the range of `FP16` is very limited when compared to that of `FP32`, meaning that sometimes (or often) values of gradients overflow and/or underflow, which affects the performance of a neural network or makes it collapse during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed precision training is one of the algorithms to circumvent that problem while maintaining the same results that we could obtain with `FP32` networks. It is well-described in [The Training with Mixed Precision User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html) and [Mixed Precision Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740).\n",
