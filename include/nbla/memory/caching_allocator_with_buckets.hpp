/** A base class of CachingAllocatorWithBuckets.

    This implements a caching logic but it leaves an instantiation of Memory
    class as a virtual function
    CachingAllocatorWithBucketsBase::make_memory_impl. It
    enables an easy realization of this allocator with any Memory class
    implementation such as CpuMemory and CudaMemory. The caching algorithm is
    described as following.

    ## Caching a previously requested memory into a memory pool

    This allocator maintains a memory pool as a map from a requested memory
    configuration to a Memory instance previously created. A created memory
    block is re-used without allocation and free, which significantly reduces
    overhead due to memory allocation and deallocation, and implicit
    synchronization of device execution queues in CUDA for example.

    ## Size dependent memory pool

    A memory pool is maintained as two seperated pools for small size and large
    size memory respectively. By default, memory size less than 1MB is
    considered as a small block, otherwise large.

    ## Rounding rules of memory size

    A requested memory size is rounded to a multiple of round_small_ (512B by
    default) or round_large_ (128KB by default) for small or large blocks
    respectively.

    ## Creation rules

    If any of previously created memory block larger than a requested size
    is not found, a new Memory instance is created. If found, a minimum size
    memory block is used after applying the following split rule.

    ## Split rules

    If the size of the found memory block is greater than or equal to
    round_small_ (512B by default) or small_alloc_ (1MB by default) + 1 for
    small or large respectively, the found memory block is split into two at an
    offset position by a requested size after rounding, then the second one is
    returned to the pool, and the first one is used.
