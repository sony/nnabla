@brief Broadcastable Add2 operation.
@note This shouldn't be used by users. This is used in Add2. Other elementwise
binary operations are not implementing broadcastable because the original
implementations are already broadcastable. Add2 is a special case in which
in-place computation is allowed. We need this for an implementation for
broadcastable Add2. If Add2's inputs require broadcasting, it's fallback into
BcAdd2 operation. See setup_impl of add2.cpp.
