Q. I want to use another linux distribution.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We actually tested other linux distributions and versions; Ubuntu 20.04, CentOS 7, 8 on various environments; Baremetal server, AWS instance, and/or Docker machine. Thus, you can install in almost the same way described here. The details of how-to-install for each are coming soon.
