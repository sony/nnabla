Operator support status
=======================

Support status importing from ONNX
----------------------------------

This is a status list of [ONNX operators](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md)
that indicates if each operator can be converted to NNP.

- OK The ONNX operator can map to a NNabla operator.
- Not test means the ONNX operator has not been verified. It might be one of the following cases:
    - The ONNX operator hasn't been checked if it can be converted to NNabla.
    - The ONNX operator has been checked if it can be converted to NNabla, but the implementation has not started.
    - The solution is not perfect/finished, for example, the operator can map to a combination of NNabla operators.
    - Hard to find a solution with existing NNabla operators.

Total 44/108

As the following table, Opset column means the maximal opset version are supported to convert to NNP.
In user's model, if there is any function opset version exceed the maximal opset(as the following table), the importer
might fail to convert NNP model due to this function.

Support status exporting to ONNX
----------------------------------

The column of opset means current operator is mapped with which the opset specifications. For example,
Affine() is converted to 3 onnx functions, Reshape@5, Flatten@1, Gemm@6 and so on. Hence, the exporter
will generate the onnx model which require the executor at least support opset 6, when the model contains
Affine() function.
