    Embed slices a matrix/tensor with indexing array/tensor. Weights are initialized with :obj:`nnabla.initializer.UniformInitializer` within the range of :math:`-\\sqrt{3}` and :math:`\\sqrt{3}`.

    Args:
        x(~nnabla.Variable): [Integer] Indices with shape :math:`(I_0, ..., I_N)`
        n_inputs : number of possible inputs, words or vocabraries
        n_features : number of embedding features
        fix_parameters (bool): When set to `True`, the embedding weight matrix
            will not be updated.

    Returns:
        ~nnabla.Variable: Output with shape :math:`(I_0, ..., I_N, W_1, ..., W_M)`
