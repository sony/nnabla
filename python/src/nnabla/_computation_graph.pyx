    '''Performs a forward propagation up to variables specified as the 1st
    argument.

    Args:
            clear_buffer (bool): Clear the no longer referenced variables
                during forward propagation to save memory.
                This is usually set as True in an inference
                or a validation phase. Default is False.
            clear_no_need_grad (bool): Clear the unreferenced variables with
                need_grad=False during forward propagation.
                True is usually used when calling this during training.
                This is ignored when clear_buffer=True.
            function_pre_hook(callable):
                This callable object is called immediately before each function is executed.
                It must take :obj:`~nnabla.function.Function` as an input.
                The default is None.
            function_post_hook(callable):
                This callable object is called immediately after each function is executed.
                It must take :obj:`~nnabla.function.Function` as an input.
                The default is None.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            import numpy as np
            import nnabla as nn
            import nnabla.parametric_functions as PF

            x = nn.Variable.from_numpy_array(np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
            y = PF.affine(x, 4, name="y")
            z = PF.affine(x, 8, name="z")

            # Execute a forward propagation recursively up to y and z
            nn.forward_all([y, z], clear_buffer)
